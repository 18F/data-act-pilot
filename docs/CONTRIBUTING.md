## Welcome!

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.

## Submitting an issue

To ask a question, share an idea, or report a problem with the project, you can create an _issue_. Issues are hosted on a site called GitHub (if you're reading this, you're already on GitHub!). To create an issue -- or weigh in on one that somewhere else opened -- you must first create a GitHub account. Sign up for a free account at [github.com](https://github.com "GitHub").

Once you have an account and have logged into GitHub, visit [this project's issue page](https://github.com/18F/data-act-pilot/issues "DATA Act pilot issues page") to review the open issues. To open a new issue, click the _New issue_ button in the upper-right corner of that page.

## Tracking Progress

Some of the entries you'll see on the project's issue page represent _user stories_, or features to be added to the project. The stories that are not being actively worked on are part of the project _backlog_ and may be added in future rounds of development (called _sprints_).

For a more user-friendly view of the project backlog, we use a website called _Waffle.io_: https://waffle.io/18F/data-act-pilot.
