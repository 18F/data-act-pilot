# DATA Act broker pilot

This repository contains code for a DATA Act pilot developed with the Small Business Administration (SBA). The result is a basic DATA Act broker website that:
* Uploads DATA Act flat files from agencies,
* Validates the data, and
* Converts it to a uniform DATA Act format.

This work is a small experiment using real agency data. The diagrams and other artifacts here do not represent official DATA Act guidance or policy, and the code does not represent an official DATA Act product.

## How to

* Federal users who want to explore the DATA Act broker prototype without installing anything can use these [step-by-step instructions](docs/HOWTO.md "How to use the DATA Act Prototype Broker").
* Developers who want to install and run a local version of the DATA Act broker prototype can jump to [the installation instructions](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md "Installing the DATA Act Prototype Broker").
* Pilot project team members can push changes to 18F's hosted version of the prototype with these [deployment instructions](docs/DEPLOY.md "18F Cloud Foundry deployment").
* If you're wondering what the DATA Act is and why it's important, explore this [background page](docs/BACKGROUND.md "DATA Act Background and Links").

Vendors: Because this is a small experiment and a tiny piece of the overall DATA Act implementation, 18F is unable to speak with vendors individually about the work. We welcome the DATA Act community to follow the project and [contribute](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
